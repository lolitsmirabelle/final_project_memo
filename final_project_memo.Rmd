## Overview of Dataset

### What does it include?
The dataset includes information on the sizes of sloths, with each row being a different observed sloth. It contains the claw length, the endangered category for the sloth, what species the sloth is, what subspecies the sloth is, its size, tail length, and weight.

### Where and how will you be obtaining it? Include the link and source.
The link to the dataset can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bertiemackie/sloth-species 

### About how many observations? How many predictors?
There are 4999 observations and 7 predictors. 

### What types of variables will you be working with?
I will be working with both quantitative and qualitative data for the sloths. 
* Quantitative: Claw length, size, tail length, weight
* Qualitative: Endangered category, species, subspecies


## Overview of Research Questions

### What variable(s) are you interested in predicting? What question(s) are you interested in answering?
I am interested in predicting if a sloth is two-toed or three-toed. I am also interested in predicting what sub species a sloth belongs to.

### Name your response/outcome variable(s) and briefly describe it/them.


### Will these questions be best answered with a classification or regression approach?
I think that these questions will be best answered with a classification approach as I am predicting discrete output variables (two-toed or three-toed and subspecies of a sloth).

### Which predictors do you think will be especially useful?
I believe that the predictors that would be especially ueful in predicting if a sloth is two-toed or three-toed and what subspecies a slth is would most likely be the claw length, size, tail length, and weight of the sloth. 

### Is the goal of your model descriptive, predictive, inferential, or a combination? Explain.
I believe that the goal of my model would be
